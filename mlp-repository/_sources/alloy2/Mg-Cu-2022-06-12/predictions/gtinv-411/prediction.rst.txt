The convex hull and stable structures are obtained by performing local structure optimizations only from structure prototypes used for estimating the MLP. Therefore, they are often inconsistent with experimental structures and/or theoretical globally-stable structures. In addition, the prototype is used as the structure legend in the figure. Therefore, the structure type of the converged structure is sometimes different from that shown in the legend even if the potential energy surface predicted by MLP is almost the same as the true one.
