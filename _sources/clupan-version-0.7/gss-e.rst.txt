Ground state search
====================

gss
--------

* Searching for the ground state structures by calculating energies of all configurations within an arbitrary lattice.
* Available only for binary systems.
* Available for multi-thread calculations using OPENMP.

**Input files**

* GS.in
* :ref:`label-e-uposcar`
* :ref:`label-e-upotcar`
* :ref:`label-e-eci`
* :ref:`label-e-of-out`

**Output files**

* gs.out
* LATTICE-GSS

GS.in
--------

Energies of all structures with 12 A-atoms (spin=+1) and 4 B-atoms (spin=-1) constructed by the 2x2x1 expansion of a 4-atoms unit cell (16-atoms cell). ::

    ISUB = 1
    NUCELL = 2 2 1
    NCHANGE = 4
    SPIN = 1 -1


ISUB tag
""""""""""""""""
Sublattice indexes for considering atomic configurations.
Atomic configurations are considered on ISUBth lattice sites of UPOSCAR (line 6).

* Default : 1
* Example : ISUB = 1 3

NCHANGE tag
""""""""""""""""""""""
Number of atoms.
In N-nary systems, set N-1 kinds of atoms.
The number of the other kind of atoms is automatically set to (number of lattice sites - NCHANGE).

* Default : none
* Example : NCHANGE = 6

SPIN tag
""""""""""""""""""""""
Spin values of atoms.
In binary systems, SPIN tag has two kinds of values.
The same correspondence between spins and atom types used in **correlation** should be used here.

* Default : none
* Example : SPIN = 1 -1

In the above example, spin values of NCHANGE atoms are set to -1.

NUCELL tag
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Energies of all configurations within a supercell constructed by the NUCELL expansion of the unit cell.

* Default : none
* Example : NUCELL = 2 1 1

SYMPREC tag
""""""""""""""""
Numerical precision for searching for symmetry operations (unit: fractional coordinates).

* Default : 1e-5
* Example : SYMPREC = 1e-5
