Inorganic Compound Recommender System
======================================================

The present tensor-based recommender system database provides currently unknown chemically relevant compositions from database entries (ICSD, ICDD, and Springer Materials). The recommender system database is available from `GitHub <https://github.com/sekocha/recommender>`_.

If you use the recommender system database for academic purposes, please cite the following article [1].
