Development of cluster expansion model
=================================================================

#. Collecting DFT data ::

    # End members are identified with --end option. 
    # --end (location of vasprun.xml) 
    #       (number of formula unit in structure specified by vasprun.xml)
    #       (element type1) (element type2) ...

    $(pyclupan)/tools/collect_dft.py --end finished/1-0-0/vasprun.xml 2.0 0 2 --end finished/1-0-3/vasprun.xml 2.0 1 3 --vaspruns finished/*/vasprun.xml

#. Model estimation ::

    $(pyclupan)/regression/regression.py -x ../4-correlation/correlations.pkl -y ../2-dft/summary_dft.yaml --upper_bound 0.5

#. Prediction by cluster expansion model ::

    # Correlation functions for target structures must be computed in advance.

    $(pyclupan)/prediction/prediction.py -x ../4-correlation/correlations.pkl --coeffs ../5-reg/regression.yaml
