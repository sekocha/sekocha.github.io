Counting numbers of colored clusters in derivative structures
=================================================================

**Counting numbers of colored clusters** ::

    $(pyclupan)/features/count_clusters.py

    usage: count_clusters.py [-h] [--derivative [DERIVATIVE [DERIVATIVE ...]]]
                         [--clusters_yaml CLUSTERS_YAML]
                         [--poscars [POSCARS [POSCARS ...]]]
                         [--n_cell_ub N_CELL_UB] [--yaml]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --derivative [DERIVATIVE [DERIVATIVE ...]]
                            Location of DSSet pkl files
      --clusters_yaml CLUSTERS_YAML
                            Location of clusters.yaml
      --poscars [POSCARS [POSCARS ...]]
                            POSCARs
      --n_cell_ub N_CELL_UB
                            Maximum number of cells
      --yaml                generating yaml file


(Examples)

#. Counting number of colored clusters in derivative structures ::

    # Lattice ID 0: fcc lattice sites
    $(pyclupan)/features/count_clusters.py --derivative ../1-derivative/derivative-all.pkl --clusters_yaml ../2-cluster/clusters.yaml

#. Examples for parsing results of count_clusters ::
    
    yaml = Yaml()
    cluster_set, orbit_sizes, target_ids, n_counts \
            = yaml.parse_count_clusters_yaml('count_clusters.yaml')

    cluster_set, orbit_sizes, target_ids, n_counts \
            = joblib.load('count_clusters.pkl')
