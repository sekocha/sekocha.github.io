Installation
============================================================

Required C++ libraries 
-----------------------------

#. `Armadillo (required version >= 8.600) <http://arma.sourceforge.net>`_
#. `boost C++ Libraries <https://www.boost.org/>`_
#. libboost_python3
#. GNU Scientific Library (GSL)

Required Python modules
-------------------------------
#. numpy
#. scipy
#. scikit-learn
#. joblib
#. sympy (optional)
#. spglib (optional)
#. pymatgen (optional)

Required C++ libraries to build only a library for lammps
---------------------------------------------------------------------
#. `Armadillo (required version >= 8.600) <http://arma.sourceforge.net>`_
#. `boost C++ Libraries <https://www.boost.org/>`_

No python modules are required.

How to build libraries on pyml
--------------------------------------

#. Modify links for armadillo and libboost_python3 libraries, and include path for python.h in $(pyml)/c++/makefile.

#. Build two libraries of pymlcpp.so (used by python codes) and libmlip.so (used by C++ codes such as lammps) as ::
    
    pyml=~/git/pyml 
    cd $(pyml)/c++
    make

   pymlcpp.so and libmlip.so are generated in $(pyml)/c++/lib. 
   When building only libmlip.so, use "make lammps" instead of "make" as ::
    
    pyml=~/git/pyml 
    cd $(pyml)/c++
    make lammps

   Only libmlip.so is generated in $(pyml)/c++/lib.

#. Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for pymlcpp and libmlip.so as ::
    
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pyml)/c++/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   If required, set additional LD_LIBRARY_PATH for other libraries such as boost ::

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/usr/local/boost/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#. Set PYMLPATH to use group-theoretical invariants as ::
    
    PYMLPATH=$(pyml)/c++/lib

..  Build lammps after setting PYMLPATH.
